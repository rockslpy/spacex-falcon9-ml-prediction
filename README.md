# spacex-falcon9-ml-prediction

This repository is for the capstone project of Applied Data Science Capstone course in IBM Data Science Professional Certificate as well as the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.

This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

In this project, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.

Methodologies:
- Data Collection with SpaceX RESTful API and Web Scraping
- Data Wrangling
- EDA with Data Visualization and SQL
- Build an Interactive Map with Folium
- Build a Dashboard with Plotly Dash
- Predictive Analysis (Classification) with Machine Learning Algorithms as follows:
  Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifier and K-nearest Neighbors
